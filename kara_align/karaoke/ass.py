"""Karaoke subtitles as ASS, laid out chunk by chunk.

Every lyric line becomes a row of *chunks*.  A chunk is a piece of the line
that carries one ruby group (a kanji word and its reading) or plain text; kana
around kanji are split off so ruby sits only over kanji.  Widths are measured
with the fonts libass will draw with (``fonts.Measurer``), so the layout is
computed here: chunk widths (a reading may overhang a neighbour without ruby,
never another reading), the line's place in its row (alternating left / right,
shrunk to fit the margins), the row (``schedule``: lines take turns in
``layout.lines`` rows; a line sung while every row is still busy — a duet, a
backing vocal — gets an extra row beyond the block) and when it shows
(``lead_in`` / ``hold`` / early show, hidden across long pauses inside it).

Each chunk is written as its own positioned event (lyric) plus an optional ruby
event above it:

* ruby ``own``: both are ``\\kf`` / ``\\k`` karaoke events built from the unit
  times of the alignment result (manual edits included);
* ruby ``base`` (与歌词对齐): lyric and ruby are drawn twice — unsung, and sung
  cut by an animated ``\\clip`` at the lyric's sweep position (the unsung copy by
  the matching ``\\iclip``, so fades never show one through the other).  The
  ruby's cut follows the lyric's while it is over the lyric and covers the whole
  reading once its chunk is sung.

Around that: optional glow layers (a blurred border under the text), the
translation (under each line, or one line at an edge), per-syllable effects
(``effects``) and the song title card (``info``).  Fades are shortened so a line
never fades while it is sung.

Times written here are on the original audio timeline plus ``time_offset_ms``
(the audio start inside a video, for burn-in / use with that video), minus the
style's ``advance_ms``.
