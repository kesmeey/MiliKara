# MiliKara HTTP API (local WebUI)

Served by `milikara serve` (FastAPI, default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`). All JSON unless noted.
Times are integer ms on the original audio timeline, intervals `[start_ms, end_ms)`.
Errors: HTTP 4xx/5xx with `{"detail": "<human readable message>"}` (pydantic body validation errors are FastAPI's 422 list).

`Project`, `LyricsDoc`, `Line`, `Segment`, `Unit`, `Calibration`, `AudioAsset`, `VideoAsset`,
`AlignmentResult`, `UnitTiming`, `Issue`, `Candidate`, `MixSettings`, `KaraokeStyle`, `AiRoundtrip` are the
pydantic models in `kara_align/models.py`, serialized as-is. `AppSettings` / `TaskStyleOptions` are in
`kara_align/settings.py`, `PipelineTask` in `kara_align/pipeline.py`.

## 快速上手：用脚本提交任务

下面是用脚本驱动极简模式的完整流程（服务默认在 `http://127.0.0.1:8765`；脚本请求不需要浏览器的 `Origin` 头，只要发往本机地址）。完整的接口说明在后面的英文参考里。

**1. 添加任务**：`file` 是视频或音频；`lyrics` 是网易云 / QQ 音乐的歌曲链接或 LRC / 纯文本歌词；`background`（可选）是背景图片或循环播放的背景视频；`style`（可选）是这首歌的字幕选项（JSON，不给则用上次的选择）。

```bash
curl -F file=@song.mp3 -F background=@cover.jpg \
     -F lyrics='https://music.163.com/song?id=505665083' -F mode=lrc \
     http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/tasks
```

返回的 `PipelineTask` 里有任务 `id`。

**2. 查看进度**：`GET /api/tasks` 返回所有任务（新的在前）。`status` 为 `preparing` / `queued` / `running` 时继续等待；`succeeded` 时 `outputs.video.url` 就是成品视频的下载地址；`failed` 时看 `error`。

**3. 任务在等你（`status` 为 `waiting`）**：看哪个步骤的 `status` 是 `waiting`。

- `calibrate`（确认第一句从哪里开始唱）：`task.calibration` 里有第一句的歌词和它在 LRC 里的时间 `lrc_ms`。
  `POST /api/tasks/{id}/calibration`，body `{"marked_ms": 14684}`（第一句实际开始唱的毫秒数），或 `{"plain": true}` 改用普通模式。
  设置里把“歌词开头对齐”改成自动检测（`simple.calibration: "auto"`）后，只有没把握时才会停在这里。
- `readings`（AI 注音选了“手动（网页聊天）”）：`GET /api/tasks/{id}/readings/prompt` 取提示词，发给任意 AI，
  再 `POST /api/tasks/{id}/readings`，body `{"text": "<AI 的完整回复>"}`；不想注音就 `{"skip": true}`。回复完全不能用时返回 400 和原因，任务继续等待。

**4. 下载视频**：`GET` 第 2 步里的 `outputs.video.url`。

只用 Python 标准库的例子（添加任务后一直等到完成，第一句的位置已知时自动确认）：

```python
import json, time, urllib.request, uuid

BASE = "http://127.0.0.1:8765"

def call(method, path, body=None):
    req = urllib.request.Request(BASE + path, method=method,
                                 data=json.dumps(body).encode() if body is not None else None,
                                 headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.load(r)

def add_task(media, lyrics, background=None, mode="lrc"):
    boundary, body = uuid.uuid4().hex, b""
    for k, v in {"lyrics": lyrics, "mode": mode}.items():
        body += f'--{boundary}\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="{k}"\r\n\r\n{v}\r\n'.encode()
    for k, path in {"file": media, "background": background}.items():
        if path:
            name = path.rsplit("/", 1)[-1]
            body += f'--{boundary}\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="{k}"; filename="{name}"\r\n\r\n'.encode()
            body += open(path, "rb").read() + b"\r\n"
    body += f"--{boundary}--\r\n".encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(BASE + "/api/tasks", data=body, method="POST",
                                 headers={"Content-Type": f"multipart/form-data; boundary={boundary}"})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.load(r)

task = add_task("song.mp3", "https://music.163.com/song?id=505665083", background="cover.jpg")
while True:
    t = next(x for x in call("GET", "/api/tasks") if x["id"] == task["id"])
    if t["status"] == "waiting":
        waiting = next(s["key"] for s in t["stages"] if s["status"] == "waiting")
        if waiting == "calibrate":
            call("POST", f"/api/tasks/{t['id']}/calibration", {"marked_ms": 14684})
        elif waiting == "readings":
            call("POST", f"/api/tasks/{t['id']}/readings", {"skip": True})
    elif t["status"] in ("succeeded", "failed", "cancelled"):
        print(t["status"], t.get("outputs"), t.get("error"))
        break
    time.sleep(2)
```

## Access and status codes

- **Local only.** Requests whose `Host` is not `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]` get **403** (DNS rebinding);
  more host names can be allowed with `milikara serve --allow-host NAME` (repeatable; `--host` with a named
  address allows that name too). A request other than GET / HEAD / OPTIONS that carries an `Origin` of another
  site (scheme not http/https, or host:port ≠ `Host`) gets **403** (CSRF).
- **400**: invalid input or a state that does not allow the operation (`ServiceError`, `ProjectError`, mix / fetch errors).
- **404**: unknown or invalid project id (ids must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`), unknown result id
  (`/results/{rid}/…`, `result_id=` of an export), job, task, exported file.
- **409**: see [Conflicts](#conflicts-409).
- **413**: text body > 5 MB, upload > 8 GB (media), project.json > 64 MB, package > 4 GB.
- **422**: body does not match its schema, e.g. an unknown `kind` in `PATCH …/lines/{id}` (`lyric|translation|romanization|meta|blank`)
  or an unknown lyrics `origin` (`paste|upload|netease|qq|project|manual`).

## General

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/info` | – | `{version, backends: [{name, description, languages, default_model, default_revision, license, available, missing}], separation_presets: [{name, model_filename, architecture, notes, license_note, leading_padding_samples}], separation_available: bool, tasks_elsewhere: bool, export_formats: {fmt: {filename, description}}}` |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{job_id}` | – | `Job` = `{id, kind, project_id, status: queued\|running\|succeeded\|failed\|cancelled, progress 0..1, message, error, created, finished, output}` |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` | – | `Job` |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/jobs` | – | `[Job]` |

Job kinds: `align`, `separate`, `ai`, `calibrate`, `mix`, `video`, `burn`. Heavy jobs (align, separate, calibrate, burn)
run one at a time and share one lock with the simple-mode queue. Cancelling a job (or stopping the server) stops its
subprocesses: separation, AI CLI processes (the whole process group), ffmpeg. Jobs live in memory: after a restart
they are gone (the UI shows an operation that was running as failed: the local server was restarted).

`tasks_elsewhere: true` means another server process on the same workspace runs the simple-mode task queue (see below).

## Projects

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/projects` | – | `[{id, name, mode, updated, size}]` newest first (`size`: bytes of the project folder; unreadable projects are left out) |
| POST | `/api/projects` | `{name, mode: "plain"\|"lrc"}` | `ProjectView` |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}` | – | `ProjectView` |
| PATCH | `/api/projects/{pid}` | `{name?, mode?, config?: AlignConfig (partial ok), mix?: MixSettings (partial ok)}` | `ProjectView`; every value is checked before anything changes (NaN / ∞ → 400) |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/{pid}` | – | `{ok}`; deletes the project folder (audio, stems, exports) and the playback / waveform cache of audio no other project has. 409 while a simple-mode task or a job works on it |
| POST | `/api/projects/import` | multipart `file` (project.json or .kara.zip) | `ProjectView`; the imported project always gets a **new id** (an id in the file is never used as a folder name) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/package?include_audio=1` | – | zip download (built in a temporary folder, not kept in `exports/`) |

`ProjectView` = `{project: Project, view: {effective_starts: {line_id: {ms, kind: "soft"|"hard"}}, calibration_issues: [Issue], mode_notice: str|null, results: [ResultSummary], capability_warnings: [str], audio: {role: {asset_id, duration_ms, sample_rate, available: bool, outdated: bool}}, picture: {source: "background"|"video"|"black", width, height, kind?: "image"|"video", filename?}}}` (`picture`: what a burned video shows by default and its frame size).

- `ResultSummary` = `{id, created, mode, stale, stale_reason, coverage, parent_result_id, n_units, n_failed, n_issues, n_manual, audio_role, backend}`.
- `audio.*.outdated`: a vocals / instrumental stem separated from an original that has since been replaced; such stems are
  not `available` (not used for alignment, listening, mixes or reduced-vocal videos) until separated again.
- Some endpoints add fields to the `ProjectView`: `messages` (lyrics/apply), `report` (readings/prepare),
  `summary` (ai/apply), `result_id` (results/import), `paired` (lyrics/fetch-translation).

Result staleness is recomputed on every read: results whose input snapshot no longer matches the current
lyrics text / readings / voices, unit flags, segment languages, anchor tolerances, end marks (`stats.detail_revision`) /
calibration / mode / audio get `stale: true` with a reason (still viewable).

Stored data is read leniently: `MixSettings` values outside their ranges go back to the default, a damaged
`project.json` is replaced by `project.json.bak` (the damaged file is kept as `project.broken-<time>.json`).
Content hashes (`sha256`) must be 64 lowercase hex characters.

## Lyrics input (paste and upload share the same path: uploads are read as text by the browser and sent with `origin: "upload"` + `filename`)

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/parse` | `{text, origin: "paste"\|"upload", filename?}` | `LyricsPreview` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/apply` | `{preview_id}` | `ProjectView` + `messages: [str]` (replaces the lyrics doc; old results become stale) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/track/preview` | `{text, kind: "translation"\|"romanization", origin, filename?}` | `{kind, pairs: [{line_id, line_text, text, method: "time"\|"nearest"\|"order", delta_ms}], unmatched_line_ids: [str], unmatched: [text]}` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/track/apply` | `{kind, pairs: [{line_id, text}]}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/fetch-translation` | – | `ProjectView` + `paired: int` (the translation of the NetEase / QQ song the lyrics came from; 400 when there is none) |
| POST | `/api/lyrics/link` | `{text}` (URL / share text / short link / `netease:123` / `qq:mid`) | `{kind: "song", song: FetchedSong}` or `{kind: "collection", platform, title, songs: [{platform, song_id, title, artists, album, duration_ms}]}` |
| POST | `/api/lyrics/song` | `{platform, song_id}` | `{kind: "song", song: FetchedSong}` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lyrics/from-song` | `{platform, song_id}` | `LyricsPreview` (original track; translation/romanization offered as `extra_tracks`; plus `song` without `tracks`) |

`lyrics/parse` also accepts `prepared.json` (lyrics with readings). For project / alignment / reading-patch JSON it returns an `error` plus `route` naming where that file belongs.

`LyricsPreview` = `{preview_id, detected, warnings: [str], error: str|null, doc: LyricsDoc, extra_tracks: {kind: text}}`. When `error` is set (e.g. LRC mode without valid times) the preview cannot be applied; the UI must offer to add times or switch mode.
`FetchedSong` = `{platform, song_id, title, artists: [str], album, duration_ms, tracks: {original?, translation?, romanization?}, has_timestamps: {track: bool}, …}`.

Applying other lyrics un-confirms the LRC calibration (unless every timed line and `[offset]` is unchanged); the reference
mark and check marks stay only on lines with the same text and time, and a shift that belonged to other lyrics is reset
to 0 with a message (undo: `calibration/undo`). QQ Music's `//` placeholder lines never become translations.

## Lines and readings

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PATCH | `/api/projects/{pid}/lines/{line_id}` | `{text?, sing?, kind?, translation?, voice?, countdown?: "auto"\|"on"\|"off"}` | `ProjectView` (a line edited, or switched back to a sung lyric without units, gets rule readings at once) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lines/merge` | `{line_ids}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/lines/{line_id}/split` | `{at: int (char index)}` | `ProjectView` |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/lines/{line_id}/anchor` | `{abs_ms: int\|null, hard: bool, tolerance_ms}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/readings/prepare` | `{overwrite_rule: bool}` | `ProjectView` + `report` |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/lines/{line_id}/segments/{segment_id}` | `{reading, units?: [str], confirm: bool}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/ai/prompt` | `{line_ids?: [str]}` | `{prompt, snapshot_id, roundtrip_id}` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/ai/validate` | `{text}` (raw chat reply or JSON) | `{report_id, report: PatchReport}` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/ai/auto` | `{line_ids?}` | `Job` (kind `ai`; output = the `/ai/validate` response + `meta {provider, attempts: [{provider, model, elapsed_s, cost_usd}], cost_usd}`; nothing applied). 400 when the provider is `manual` (use `/ai/prompt` + `/ai/validate`) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/ai/apply` | `{report_id, line_ids?: [str]}` | `ProjectView` + `summary`. 409 when a line of the report no longer exists (lines merged / split since the validation) |

`PatchReport` = `{ok: bool, snapshot, roundtrip_id, errors: [str], warnings: [str], missing_line_ids: [str], lines: [{line_id, status: "ok"|"stale_text"|"stale_reading"|"unknown_line"|"locked_skipped"|"invalid"|"duplicate", reasons: [str], segments: [..], diff: [{surface, old_reading, new_reading, old_units: [str], new_units: [str], changed, locked}]}]}`.

The project keeps each round trip as an `AiRoundtrip`; its `report` is `{line_hashes, line_texts, validation}`: the
per-line reading hashes and texts taken when the prompt was made (so a later validation still sees readings changed since)
and the last `PatchReport`.

## Audio

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/background` | multipart `file`: a picture (PNG / JPG / WebP / BMP) or a video (MP4 / MOV / MKV / WebM / GIF …, ≤ 4 GiB) | `ProjectView`. Stored as `project.background` `{id, sha256, path, filename, kind: "image"\|"video", width, height, duration_ms}`; from then on preview and burn (`background: "auto"`) show it instead of the project's video / black: a picture held for the whole song, a video looped (its own sound never used), scaled to cover a frame of its aspect ratio with the longer side 1920 px; the audio is the project's (timeline from the audio start). 400 for anything else (checked by extension, content and ffprobe); 409 while a task works on the project |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/background/cover` | – | `ProjectView`: the song's cover as the background — the cover blurred and darkened over a 1920×1080 frame, the cover itself in the upper middle, the bottom darker for the lyrics (`kara_align/karaoke/cover.py`). The cover is the one of the music link the lyrics were fetched from (its URL kept in the source snapshot's `fetched_meta.cover_url`; lyrics fetched before: the platform is asked again); only from the platforms' image hosts (`p*.music.126.net`, `y.gtimg.cn`). 400: lyrics not from a link, no cover, cover unreadable. `view.cover` says whether there is one. Simple-mode tasks with audio only, lyrics from a link and no background of their own get it automatically (a warning when it fails) |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/{pid}/background` | – | `ProjectView` (back to the video / black; the file is deleted) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/background/file` | – | the background file (404 without one) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/audio` | multipart `file`, form `role: original\|vocals\|instrumental` | `ProjectView` (+ stems get `sync_report`). The file may be a **video**: its first audio track is extracted losslessly (FLAC) and used; a video uploaded as the original is kept as `project.video` (with `audio_offset_s`) for re-muxing. |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/audio/{asset_id}/playback.wav` | – | decoded PCM WAV (same decoder as alignment → identical time origin). Supports Range. |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/audio/{asset_id}/peaks?per_second=200` | – | `{sample_rate, duration_ms, per_second, mins: [float], maxs: [float]}` (mono, first peak at 0 ms) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/separate` | `{preset, device?: "auto"\|"cpu"}` | `Job` (on success adds vocals + instrumental assets). `preset` must be one of `/api/info.separation_presets` (`melband-roformer`, `bs-roformer`, `mdx-fast`, `demucs-htdemucs`), else 400. Stopped after duration × 5 + 10 min |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/mix/preview-gain` | `MixSettings` | `{bus_gain, peak_before}` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/mix/export` | `MixSettings` | `Job` (kind `mix`); output `{filename, url, report}`; `url` downloads the WAV |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/video/export` | `MixSettings` | `Job` (kind `video`); output `{filename, url, report}`: the original video's picture copied unchanged, the mix as its only soundtrack, at the original audio offset. Needs `project.video` and current stems. |

`MixSettings` = `{vocal_keep_pct: 0–100, instrumental_pct: 0–100, master: 0–4, limiter: "none"|"normalize_peak"}`; a value out of
range, NaN or not a number is refused with 400 (before a job starts).

Mix rule (same in browser and export): `mix = master × (p/100·V + q/100·I)`; bus gain `min(1, 10^(-0.3/20)/peak)` when `limiter = normalize_peak`. Browser playback computes it with GainNodes; only the export applies a precomputed bus gain from the full-file peak (the UI shows the same number from `/mix/preview-gain`).

## Timed background images

`PUT /api/projects/{pid}/background/slides` saves a slideshow (multipart):

- `files`: zero or more image uploads (PNG / JPG / WebP / BMP, each ≤ 30 MiB).
- `timeline`: a JSON array such as `[{"upload_index":0,"start_ms":0},{"upload_index":1,"start_ms":60000},{"upload_index":2,"start_ms":120000}]`.
- To reuse a saved image, use `asset_id` instead of `upload_index`. The ID must belong to the project's current slideshow or single background. Each entry specifies exactly one of these references.

The original audio must already exist. There must be 1–100 slides, starting at 0, with strictly increasing integer millisecond times before the song ends. The last slide lasts until the end of the song. The entire video uses the first image's aspect ratio (long side 1920 px); subsequent images are centred and cropped to cover it. Export switches at the first 30 fps frame at or after the specified time.

Returns `ProjectView`, with `project.background_slides: [{asset: BackgroundAsset, start_ms}]`. `view.picture.slides_count` and `slides_key` identify the current timeline for preview refresh. Preview and burn use it with `background: "auto"`; `"black"` bypasses it. Changing backgrounds leaves alignment results intact. `GET /api/projects/{pid}/background/file?asset_id=...` returns a slide image. `DELETE /api/projects/{pid}/background` clears all slides; uploading a single background or using a song cover also replaces the slideshow. Project packages with media include all background images.

For `POST /api/tasks`, send repeated multipart `background_images` files and `background_starts` as a JSON array (e.g. `[0,60000,120000]`), instead of `background`. These are validated and saved with the task, including across restarts. The returned task includes `background_slides: [{filename, start_ms}]`.

## Exported files

| Method | Path | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/exports` | `[{filename, url, size, modified}]`: files in the project's `exports/` folder, newest first (partial files whose name starts with `.` are left out). Every export gets a new name, so an earlier one is never overwritten: `<song>-karaoke[-vocal<N>\|-noaudio]-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.mp4` (burn), `<video name>-vocal<N>-<time>.<ext>` (reduced-vocal video), `<song>-mix-v<N>-i<M>-<time>.wav` (mix); local time, `-2`, `-3` … when two are made in the same second |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/exports/{filename}` | the file (download); 404 for anything that is not a plain file name in `exports/` |

Every `url` returned for an exported file (mix, video, burn, task video, this list) is
`/api/projects/{pid}/exports/{filename}` with both parts URL-encoded (names may contain `#`, `?`, `%`, spaces …).

## Calibration (LRC mode)

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/mark` | `{line_id, marked_ms}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/shift` | `{user_shift_ms}` | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/confirm-zero` | – | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/check` | `{line_id, marked_ms}` | `ProjectView` (check residual in `calibration.checks`, warnings in `view.calibration_issues`) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/undo` | – | `ProjectView` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/calibration/suggest` | – | `Job` (kind `calibrate`; output `{shift_ms, agree, tight, lines_checked, confident, reason, drift_ms, line_starts, vocal_onset_ms, audio_role}`; nothing is saved). `agree` / `tight`: share of lines within 0.7 s / 0.3 s of `shift_ms`; `confident` false with a `reason` when the estimate should not be used without listening (see `kara_align/auto_calibrate.py`). Uses the vocals only when the stems are current |

## Alignment and results

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/align` | `{line_ids?: [str], audio_role?: "original"\|"vocals", config?: partial AlignConfig}` | `Job` (output `{result_id}`) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}` | – | `AlignmentResult` (with fresh `stale`) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/import` | `{text}` (alignment.json content) | `ProjectView` + `result_id` (non-active; staleness recomputed) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/activate` | – | `ProjectView` |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/units/{uid}` | `{start_ms, end_ms, locked}` | `UnitTiming` |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/units/{uid}/manual` | – | `UnitTiming` |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/units/{uid}/lock` | `{locked}` | `UnitTiming`; 400 when the unit has no times to lock |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/units/{uid}/restore` | `{manual: ManualEdit\|null}` | `UnitTiming` (undo/redo support) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/lines/{lid}/retime` | `{start_ms?, end_ms?}` | `{units: [UnitTiming]}`: the line's timed units shifted so the first starts at `start_ms`, or with `end_ms` too mapped onto `[start_ms, end_ms)` (proportions kept; `end_ms` alone moves only the end); each becomes a locked manual edit. 400 when the line has no timed units or the times are out of order / past the audio |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/units/retime` | `{unit_ids, start_ms?, end_ms?}` | `{units: [UnitTiming]}`: the same for any set of timed units (may span lines), taken together by their outer edges |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/results/{rid}/adopt` | `{from_result_id?, candidate_id?, line_ids: [str]}` | `AlignmentResult` (copies non-locked unit times of the lines from a local rerun or a candidate; locked units untouched) |

A local rerun (`align` with `line_ids`) creates a new partial result with `parent_result_id`; it never overwrites the parent.
In plain mode it decodes only the stretch between the neighbouring lines' times in the previous result. The UI compares and adopts per line.

`AlignmentResult.stats` includes `algorithm` (currently `"kara-align-decoder/3"`), `original_sha256` (the original recording the
times refer to) and `detail_revision`. Manual edits of the previous result are applied before the checks run; they are not
carried to a different original (issue `manual_audio_changed`, the edits stay in the unit's `manual_history`), follow a reading
change by position inside the segment (`manual_reading_changed`) or are reported as dropped (`manual_dropped`). A segment with
letters / digits but no reading gives `segment_no_reading`; lines whose LRC time is after the end of the audio are left out
(`lines_after_audio`).

## Export

| Method | Path | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/export/{fmt}?result_id=&download=1` | file download (Content-Disposition with a UTF-8 file name; `X-Export-Warnings: <count>` when there are warnings) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/export/{fmt}?result_id=` | `{filename, media_type, content, warnings}` |

`fmt` ∈ `alignment, prepared, project, csv, lrc-line, lrc-unit, lrc-calibrated, karaoke-ass`; stems via `/audio/{asset_id}/playback.wav`, mix via `/mix/export`.
Warnings say when the result is stale or partial and how many lines were skipped because they are after the end of the audio.
`karaoke-ass` always uses the active result and the project's saved style (see below).

## Karaoke subtitles

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/fonts` | – | `{default, families: [{family, names, bold}]}` (fonts that can render Japanese, via fontconfig) |
| GET | `/api/karaoke/styles` | – | `[{id, name, builtin, updated, style: KaraokeStyle}]` (built-in 默认 / 暖阳 first, then the saved ones) |
| POST | `/api/karaoke/styles` | `{name, style, id?}` | the saved entry (`id` given: overwrite it; else a new one, or the one with this name). 400 for a built-in name / id or an invalid style |
| DELETE | `/api/karaoke/styles/{style_id}` | – | `{ok}` (built-ins cannot be deleted) |
| GET | `/api/karaoke/themes` | – | `{templates: [{id: "plain"\|"glow", label}], swatches}` |
| POST | `/api/karaoke/theme` | `{template, color, secondary?, base?: KaraokeStyle}` | `{palette, style}`: the colour template applied on top of `base` (default: the simple mode's style) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke` | – | `KaraokeStyle` |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke` | `KaraokeStyle` | `KaraokeStyle` (validated strictly, see below) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/info` | – | `{fields: {field: text}, labels, text: str\|null}` (title card data; `text` = the project's own text) |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/info` | `{text: str\|null}` | same as GET (`null` goes back to the song data) |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/singers` | `KaraokeSingers` | `KaraokeStyle` (only the style's singers change; validated strictly) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/singers/preset` | `{id}` | `ProjectView` + `lines` + `kept`: the singers of a saved set (below) used in this song. Parts already assigned stay with the same person: matched by name, an unnamed singer by number; one the preset lacks but the lyrics use is added after the preset's (`kept`: their names), with a free key. 404: no such preset |
| GET | `/api/karaoke/singer-presets` | – | `[{id, name, updated, singers: KaraokeSingers}]` by name (`<home>/singer_presets.json`, shared by every project) |
| POST | `/api/karaoke/singer-presets` | `{name, singers, id?}` | the saved preset (no `id`: a new one, or the one of that name replaced; 400: no name, no singers, invalid singers) |
| DELETE | `/api/karaoke/singer-presets/{id}` | – | `{ok}` |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/singers/{n}` | – | `ProjectView` + `changed` (lines whose assignment changed): singer `n` (1-based) removed, its parts go back to the line's other singers, later numbers move down by one (in combinations too; one left with fewer than two singers is removed) |
| POST | `/api/karaoke/singer-colors` | `{members: [KaraokeSinger]}` | `[{sung, unsung, outline, glow_sung, glow_unsung, translation, sparkle}]`: each singer's colours with the derived ones filled in |
| PUT | `/api/projects/{pid}/singers` | `{lines: [{line_id, singers, spans: [{start, end, singers}], text?}]}` | `ProjectView`: who sings these lines (replaces their assignment; `text`: the line's text the spans were made for, 400 when it changed since) |
| GET | `/api/projects/{pid}/singers/markers` | – | `{lines: [{line_id, text, prefix, names, everyone}], names, existing}`: lines that start with singer names (“A：”, “（XX）”, “【XX】”; a name must start at least two lines) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/singers/markers` | `{names?: [str], strip?: true}` | `ProjectView` + `messages`: those lines assigned to the named singers (new names added to the style; “全员 / 合 / ALL …” = every one of them); `strip` takes the names out of the lyrics (the text changes: results become outdated) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/preview` | `{t_ms, style?, background?: "auto"\|"black"}` | `image/png` of the whole frame at `t_ms` (libass, the video's displayed size) |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/karaoke/burn` | `{background?: "auto"\|"black", audio?: "original"\|"mix"\|"none", quality?: "standard"\|"high", vocal_keep_pct?: 0–100}` | `Job` (kind `burn`); output `{filename, url, warnings}` |

**Countdown** (开唱倒计时): `KaraokeStyle.countdown = {intro: true, interlude: true, min_gap_ms: 6000 (2000–30000), dots: 3 (2–5)}`:
dots above the start of the first line (`intro`) and of a line after a pause of at least `min_gap_ms` since everything before it
was sung (`interlude`); in the last `dots` seconds one goes each second (evenly over a shorter wait), the last as the line's sweep
starts (so with `advance_ms`). A line can override the rules: `Line.countdown` true / false (null = the rules), set with
`PATCH …/lines/{id}` `{countdown: "on"|"off"|"auto"}`. Such a line appears as its countdown begins (`dots` seconds before it is sung, not earlier with `early_show`), so the first dot goes a second after it appears. In the ASS the dots are
drawings with the style `KDots`. Simple-mode tasks: `task_style.countdown_intro` / `countdown_interlude` (null = as the style says).

**Singers** (多人演唱): `KaraokeStyle.singers = {members: [{name, key, color, color_unsung, color_sung, outline_color, glow_unsung,
glow_sung}] (any number; "" colours are derived from `color`), mix: "split"|"gradient", direction: "vertical"|"horizontal",
ruby: "auto"|"split"|"first", combos: [{key, singers, mix?, direction?}]}` (vertical: every character top to bottom; horizontal:
each run sung together left to right; `ruby`: the reading over a part sung together split like its lyric, in the first singer's
colours, or "auto" = the first singer's when split top to bottom, else split; `combos`: singers who sing together, with their own
`mix` / `direction` (null: the singers' setting) — a part sung by exactly a combination's singers, in its order or else in any
order, takes the combination's look; the same singers in the same order twice is refused when saved, dropped when loaded). `key`: the key that assigns a singer / combination on the
演唱者 page, one character of `123456789abcdefghijkmnoqrstuvwxyz` (1–9, then a–z without l and p) or "" (none); new ones take
the first free one in that order. A key that is not usable or used twice, or a combination of fewer than two singers, is
refused when saved; when loaded the key is cleared (the combination dropped). Saved before keys existed: singer n has key n
(1–9), a combination's number key becomes that character.
A translation keeps its own colours (`KTrans`); with `translation.singer_glow` (default true) its glow takes the line's singers' glow colours, several blended from left to right in the order they sing (never top to bottom); false: the translation's own glow.
Who sings is kept in the lyrics: `Line.singers` (numbers, 1-based; several = together; empty = the style's own colours) and
`Line.singer_spans: [{start, end, singers}]` (character ranges of `Line.text` sung by others than the line's singers;
blanks belong to nobody: inside a part they join it, between parts they keep the line's own singers). They
only change the subtitles' colours, never an alignment; text edits, merging and splitting lines carry them along. In the
ASS, each singer has styles `KMain_n` / `KRuby_n` / `KTrans_n` and its name in the events' Name field; a part sung together
is drawn once per singer, each copy cut to its band (`\clip`), or in thin blended strips (gradient). The project view's
`view.singer_markers` counts lines that start with singer names.

Styles are validated strictly when saved (`PUT …/karaoke`, `POST /api/karaoke/styles`: 400 for a colour that is not
`#RRGGBB` / `#RGB` or a number out of range); styles read from projects, `styles.json` or `settings.json`, the style of
`PUT /api/settings` and the `style` of a preview are clamped / fixed up instead (`#RGB` → `#RRGGBB`, numbers into their range,
unknown values → default).

## App settings and AI

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/update` | `?refresh=1` | `{enabled, current, latest, newer, portable, updater, url, error}`: is a newer version out (the latest GitHub release's `manifest.json`, asked at most every 6 h; `refresh=1` asks now). With `check_updates: false` in the settings (and no `refresh`): `{enabled: false, current}`, nothing is asked. `portable`: running from a portable package, updated with its `updater` (`更新.bat` / `更新.command`) |
| GET | `/api/storage` | – | `{root, disk: {total, free}, projects: [{id, name, mode, updated, size, parts: {media, stems, background, exports, unused, other}, exports: [{filename, size, modified}], stems, busy}], projects_size, cache: {size, parts}, models: {size, path}, leftovers: {size, parts: {asset?, upload?, folder?, deleted?}}, working}` (bytes; projects largest first). `unused`: files in `assets/` no entry points to; leftovers also count a task's staged upload once it is imported, project folders without a project file and `.deleted-*` folders (files younger than 10 min are left out) |
| POST | `/api/storage/clean` | `{cache?, leftovers?}` | the same view plus `freed`. The cache is refused (409) while a task or operation runs; leftovers skip projects something is working on |
| POST | `/api/projects/{pid}/storage/clean` | `{exports?: true \| [filename…], stems?: true}` | the same view plus `freed`: exported files (all or the ones named), the separated stems (their entries and files). 409 while a task or operation works on the project |
| GET | `/api/diagnostics` | `?task=&job=` | `{text}`: a report to paste into a bug report (version, system, Python, torch / GPU, ffmpeg + libass, the video encoder, the main settings, the task's / job's error, stages and traceback when given, the end of `~/.kara_align/logs/milikara.log`); the home folder is shown as `~`, never an API key |
| GET | `/api/settings` | – | `AppSettings` (`check_updates`: look for a newer version when the app is opened; `hardware_encoding` (default true): burn videos with a working GPU encoder, falling back to libx264; `ai.api_key` is never returned; `ai.has_api_key`, `ai.env_key_present` instead). `ai.enabled`: AI readings on / off (simple-mode tasks); `ai.provider`: `manual` (copy the prompt into any web chat and paste the reply) \| `claude` \| `codex` \| `openai`. Settings from before the switch are read as: `provider: "none"` → off + `manual`; a CLI / API provider → on, unless the old `simple.ai_readings` was false |
| PUT | `/api/settings` | partial `{ai?, simple?}` (nested merge); `ai.api_key` replaces the key only when non-empty, `ai.clear_api_key: true` removes it, `simple.reset_karaoke: true` resets the simple mode's style to the built-in 暖阳 | `AppSettings`; 400 `设置无效：…` for an invalid value |
| GET | `/api/ai/providers?refresh=0` | – | `[{id: "claude"\|"codex"\|"openai", label, available, version, detail}]`; for the CLIs also `locations: [{source: "path"\|"app"\|"wsl"\|"custom", program, distro, version, where, label}]` (every place found: PATH, a desktop app's own copy — the Claude app's `…/Claude/claude-code/<version>/`, the ChatGPT / Codex app's `codex-cli` — and, on Windows, each WSL distribution, probed with the user's login shell), `where` (the setting) and `chosen` (the one used, or null with the reason in `detail`). WSL results are cached 10 min; `refresh=1` looks again. Settings: `ai.claude_cli` / `ai.codex_cli` = `{where: "auto"\|"path"\|"app"\|"wsl:<distro>"\|"custom", path}`; "auto" tries PATH, the app's copy, then WSL |
| POST | `/api/ai/test` | optional overrides of the AI settings | `{ok, reply?, model?, elapsed_s?, cost_usd?, error?}` |

- `ai.base_url` must be an `http://` or `https://` URL without user / password; `ai.api_key_env` must match
  `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*(KEY|TOKEN)$`; `simple.separation_preset` must be a known preset.
- `/api/ai/test` with a `base_url` other than the saved one needs the `api_key` for it in the same request: the saved key
  (or the key variable) is only ever sent to the saved address.
- `settings.json` (`<KARA_ALIGN_HOME>/settings.json`, default `~/.kara_align`, mode 600): a field that is no longer valid
  falls back to its default, every other field (the API key above all) is kept; an unreadable file is kept as
  `settings.broken-<time>.json` and the defaults are used. An unreadable `styles.json` (saved styles) is kept as
  `styles.broken.json` (or `styles.broken-<time>-<id>.json` when that exists); a saved entry this version cannot read is
  skipped and written back unchanged.

## Simple-mode task queue

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/tasks` | – | `[PipelineTask]` newest first (without `karaoke`, `detail`, `warning_stage`) |
| POST | `/api/tasks` | multipart: `file` (video / audio), `lyrics` (music link or lyrics text), `mode` (`lrc`\|`plain`), `name?`, `style?` (JSON `TaskStyleOptions`: source / template / colours / saved preset / translation / title card / ruby / video sound; omitted = the last choices), `background?` (a picture or a video played in a loop behind the subtitles, as `PUT …/background`; checked before the task is added, 400 when unusable) | `PipelineTask` (with its `karaoke`, `video` and `processing` snapshots) |
| POST | `/api/tasks/{id}/cancel` | – | `PipelineTask` |
| POST | `/api/tasks/{id}/retry` | – | `PipelineTask` (continues from the stage that did not finish) |
| POST | `/api/tasks/{id}/calibration` | `{marked_ms}` (first sung onset of `calibration.line_id`) or `{plain: true}` | `PipelineTask` (only while `waiting`; the task continues) |
| GET | `/api/tasks/{id}/readings/prompt` | – | `{prompt, lines, snapshot_id}` (AI readings by hand: the prompt to copy into a web chat; 400 when the task has none) |
| POST | `/api/tasks/{id}/readings` | `{text}` (the chat's reply) or `{skip: true}` | `PipelineTask` (only while the `readings` stage waits; the reply is checked like `/ai/validate` and the lines that pass are applied; 400 with the reasons when no line is usable — the task keeps waiting; 409 while a detailed-mode job runs on the project) |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | – | `{ok}` (the project stays) |

Adding a task from a script (e.g. with audio downloaded elsewhere): no browser `Origin` header is needed, only a local `Host`.

```bash
curl -F file=@song.mp3 -F background=@cover.jpg -F lyrics='https://music.163.com/song?id=347230' -F mode=lrc \
     http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/tasks
```

`PipelineTask` = `{id, created, finished, name, mode, media_filename, background_filename, lyrics_kind: "link"|"text", lyrics_input, status, project_id, project_deleted, progress, message, error, warnings: [str], current_stage, stages: [{key, label, status, progress, message, failed_soft}], outputs: {video?: {filename, url}}, calibration, calibration_confirmed, video: TaskVideo, processing: TaskProcessing, style_label, style_colors: [str], style_applied, name_auto}` (+ `karaoke: KaraokeStyle`, `detail` (traceback) and `warning_stage` in the responses of the POST endpoints, not in the list).

- `status`: `preparing|queued|running|waiting|succeeded|failed|cancelled|interrupted`; stage keys `import, lyrics, calibrate, readings, separate, align, export` in the order they run (tasks whose AI readings go through a web chat by hand — `processing.ai_provider: "manual"` — run `readings` in the preparation lane and wait there with `readings_request: {roundtrip_id, snapshot_id, lines, chars}`; tasks with `processing.calibration: "auto"` run `calibrate` — labelled 检测偏移 — after `separate`), stage status `pending|running|waiting|done|skipped|failed`.
- `calibration` (LRC mode, while `waiting`): `{line_id, line_text, lrc_ms, lines: [{id, text, lrc_ms}], check_line, asset_id, duration_ms, lines_after_audio, lines_total}`; the list adds `current_ms` (the project's current offset applied to `lrc_ms`, when one was set in the detailed mode, else `null`); after a confirmation it holds `confirmed_ms`. Automatic tasks that were not sure enough add `auto: {shift_ms, tight, lines, tight_lines, drift_ms, reason, confident}` (only `{reason}` when no estimate could be made); an automatic task that was sure goes on without waiting.
- `video` = `{auto_export, video_audio, vocal_keep_pct, quality}`, `processing` = `{ai_provider, ai_model, ai_readings (= `ai.enabled` when added), separate, separation_preset, separation_device, calibration: "manual"|"auto"}` (`calibration` from `simple.calibration`), both fixed when the task is added. `style_label` / `style_colors` describe the task's subtitle style for the list.
- `project_deleted: true`: the project was deleted in the detailed mode; the task stays listed without links and cannot be retried.
- When `tasks.json` cannot be written (disk full …) the running task gets a warning.

One server process per workspace runs the queue: it holds an exclusive lock on `<workspace>/.tasks/lock`. Another process
on the same workspace only shows the tasks (`/api/info.tasks_elsewhere: true`) and answers 409 to every change.
Stopping the server: tasks that had not started yet go back to `queued` / `preparing` (continued after the restart), running
ones become `interrupted` (retry continues them). An unreadable `tasks.json` is kept as `tasks.broken-<time>.json`.

## Conflicts (409)

- Task queue: removing a running task; retrying a task that is not failed / cancelled / interrupted; any change
  (add / cancel / retry / confirm / remove) while another server process runs the queue.
- While a simple-mode task is working on a project (preparing / waiting / queued / running), `POST …/align`, `…/separate`,
  `…/ai/auto`, `…/karaoke/burn`, `…/audio`, `…/calibration/suggest` and `DELETE /api/projects/{pid}` answer 409 with the task's name in `detail`.
- Conversely `POST /api/tasks/{id}/retry` and `/calibration` answer 409 while a detailed-mode `align`, `separate` or `ai` job
  runs on the task's project (jobs that only read the project — burns, exports, the offset suggestion — do not block them).
- `DELETE /api/projects/{pid}` while any job of the project is queued or running.
- `POST …/ai/apply` with a report whose lines no longer exist (lyrics merged / split since the validation).
